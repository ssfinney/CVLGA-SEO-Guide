# SEO Guide
A guide for implementing Search Engine Optimization using the website of the [Chattahoochee Valley Libraries](http://cvlga.org/) in Columbus, GA as an example. It's all written in Markdown and exported out as a PDF. I've focused on optimizing for Google, since it's still the dominant search engine, although these tips should apply to most other engines as well.

# About this guide
